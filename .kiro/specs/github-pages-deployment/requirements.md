# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the Eurotrip Planner application to be deployed and hosted on GitHub Pages, making it publicly accessible to users without requiring local setup. The deployment should maintain all existing functionality while ensuring optimal performance and accessibility through GitHub's hosting platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the Eurotrip Planner to GitHub Pages, so that users can access the application directly through a public URL without needing to run it locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to GitHub Pages THEN it SHALL be accessible via a public GitHub Pages URL
2. WHEN users visit the GitHub Pages URL THEN the application SHALL load completely with all assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, data files)
3. WHEN the application loads on GitHub Pages THEN all interactive map functionality SHALL work identically to local development
4. WHEN users interact with the map on GitHub Pages THEN API calls to Ryanair SHALL function properly with CORS handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment to GitHub Pages, so that updates to the main branch are automatically reflected on the live site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically deploy the updated application to GitHub Pages
2. WHEN the deployment process runs THEN it SHALL complete successfully without manual intervention
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain the previous working version
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the live site SHALL reflect the latest changes within 5 minutes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the GitHub Pages site to load quickly and work reliably, so that I can plan my European trips without technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the GitHub Pages site THEN the initial page load SHALL complete within 3 seconds on standard broadband connections
2. WHEN users interact with the map THEN all airport markers and route visualizations SHALL render correctly
3. WHEN users search for airports THEN the search functionality SHALL work without errors
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the application SHALL gracefully fall back to distance-based pricing estimates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper repository configuration for GitHub Pages, so that the deployment process is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is configured THEN GitHub Pages SHALL be enabled with the correct source branch and folder settings
2. WHEN the repository contains deployment configuration THEN it SHALL include proper GitHub Actions workflow files
3. WHEN the deployment configuration is updated THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing project structure
4. IF custom domain is desired THEN the system SHALL support CNAME configuration for custom domain setup

## Technical Notes

### Path Resolution Fix

The original code used relative paths `../data/` for JSON file loading, which can cause issues on GitHub Pages. This has been corrected to use `./data/` paths relative to the root directory.

### Mock API Implementation

The current implementation uses mock data for flight pricing instead of real Ryanair API calls, which eliminates CORS concerns for GitHub Pages deployment. The mock data provides realistic pricing based on distance calculations.
