# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive linting capabilities to the Eurotrip Planner project to maintain code quality and consistency across multiple file types. The linting system will support JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Markdown, JSON, SVG, and TOML files with minimal configuration overhead, following the project's preference for simple, direct solutions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated linting for JavaScript and TypeScript files, so that I can maintain consistent code quality and catch potential issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript or TypeScript files are linted THEN the system SHALL check for syntax errors, code style violations, and potential bugs
2. WHEN linting rules are violated THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with file locations and line numbers
3. WHEN the project uses ES2020+ features THEN the linter SHALL support modern JavaScript syntax including async/await, arrow functions, and const/let
4. WHEN TypeScript files are present THEN the linter SHALL validate TypeScript-specific syntax and type usage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want linting for markup and styling files (HTML, CSS, SVG), so that I can ensure proper structure and formatting of presentation code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTML files are linted THEN the system SHALL validate semantic markup, accessibility attributes, and proper tag nesting
2. WHEN CSS files are linted THEN the system SHALL check for syntax errors, unused selectors, and formatting consistency
3. WHEN SVG files are linted THEN the system SHALL validate XML structure and SVG-specific attributes
4. WHEN markup errors are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on fixing structural issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want linting for configuration and documentation files (JSON, TOML, Markdown), so that I can maintain consistency across all project files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON files are linted THEN the system SHALL validate JSON syntax and formatting
2. WHEN TOML files are linted THEN the system SHALL check TOML syntax and structure
3. WHEN Markdown files are linted THEN the system SHALL validate markdown syntax, link integrity, and formatting consistency
4. WHEN configuration files have errors THEN the system SHALL prevent build or runtime issues by catching syntax problems early

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple command to run all linting checks, so that I can easily validate the entire project before committing changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the lint command is executed THEN the system SHALL check all supported file types in the project
2. WHEN linting is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of issues found across all file types
3. WHEN no issues are found THEN the system SHALL exit with success status
4. WHEN issues are found THEN the system SHALL exit with error status and detailed issue reports
5. WHEN the lint command includes a fix flag THEN the system SHALL automatically fix auto-fixable issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want minimal configuration overhead for the linting setup, so that I can focus on coding rather than maintaining complex tooling configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the linting system is set up THEN it SHALL use sensible defaults that work with the existing project structure
2. WHEN custom rules are needed THEN the system SHALL allow simple configuration overrides without complex setup
3. WHEN new file types are added THEN the linting system SHALL automatically detect and lint them based on file extensions
4. WHEN the project structure changes THEN the linting configuration SHALL continue to work without manual updates
