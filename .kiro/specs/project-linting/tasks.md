# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Install and configure Biome as the primary linting tool

  - Install @biomejs/biome as a dev dependency with exact version
  - Create biome.json configuration file with project-specific settings
  - Configure file inclusion/exclusion patterns for the project structure
  - Set up JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and JSON linting rules
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 2. Add supplementary linting tools for additional file types

  - Install markdownlint-cli2 for Markdown file linting
  - Install taplo for TOML file linting and formatting
  - Install svglint for SVG file validation
  - Create configuration files for each supplementary tool
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.2, 3.3, 5.1_

- [x] 3. Create unified package.json scripts for linting operations

  - Add main "lint" script that runs all linting tools
  - Add individual lint scripts for each tool (lint:biome, lint:markdown, etc.)
  - Add "lint:fix" script that auto-fixes issues across all tools
  - Add individual fix scripts for each tool that supports auto-fixing
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.3_

- [x] 4. Configure file type detection and processing

  - Set up file patterns for each linting tool to target correct file types
  - Configure ignore patterns to exclude node_modules, .git, and build directories
  - Ensure proper file extension handling for all supported types
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 5. Implement error handling and reporting



  - Configure proper exit codes for CI/CD integration
  - Set up clear error message formatting across all tools
  - Ensure linting continues for other files when individual files fail
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
